# [Bit Manipulation](https://leetcode.com/discuss/study-guide/1151183/tips-hacks-which-you-cant-ignore-as-a-coder)


Binary AND(&) -> if any of the bit is 0, resultant would be zero also

Binary OR(|) -> if any one of the bit is 1, resultant would be 1 also

Binary XOR(^) -> if both bits are same, result would be 0 otherise 1 

Binary NOT(~) -> it flips the bit

Left Shift(<<) -> multilpies the number with power of 2 to the variable you shifted number to

Right Shift(>>) -> same but it got divided here
